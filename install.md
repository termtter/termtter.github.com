# How to Install

Termtter is available as rubygems.

Installing termtter is as easy as typing:

    gem install termtter

## for Mac OSX

Termtter often does not work on pre-installed Ruby on OSX(Maybe libreadline problem).

In that case, you need to install Ruby by MacPorts or Homebrew.

### MacPorts:

    % sudo port install ruby

### Homebrew

    % brew install readline
    % brew install ruby


## for Windows

I can't figure out.

## for Developers

You can get the latest version (not stable) from GitHub.

    % git clone git://github.com/termtter/termtter.git

Execute latest version use ./bin/termtter:

    % cd termtter
    % ./bin/termtter
